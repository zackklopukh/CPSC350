CPSC 350 Section 2

TO USE THIS PROGRAM:
Add the desired text file with instructions and
send it as an input in the command line before run

This program has been implemented correctly from my testing.
It uses no non-primative data types besdies the ListQueue which
was implemented using the dblList that was also implemented.

This was a tricky beast to get correctly, but I believe its
wokring and there's no issue with memory deallocation.
